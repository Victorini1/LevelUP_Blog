      Here is a safe haven from those who would do you harm, or just judge you. Here you have the freedom to share a videogame which you enjoyed or maybe one that you planned on getting to in the future, judgement free. You'll be able to comment on others post about a videogame you may have shared and liked or maybe argue about the statistics of your favorite character. You do you.
